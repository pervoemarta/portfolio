# Exploratory Data Analysis:
**Research of flat announcements for sale.**  
We have data from the Yandex.Real Estate service - an archive of advertisements for flats for sale in St. Petersburg and neighbouring settlements for several years. We need to learn how to determine the market value of properties. Our task is to set the parameters. This will allow us to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

For each flat for sale, two types of data are available. The first is entered by the user, the second is obtained automatically on the basis of map data. For example, the distance to the centre, airport, nearest park and water body.  
 
Compile portraits of users using **pandas**, **plotly**, **seaborn**, **matplotlib**
