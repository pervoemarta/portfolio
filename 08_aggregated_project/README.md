# Aggregated study project

## Task 1: Analysing the bank's customer churn 
  
Analyse the customers of a regional bank and identify the customer segments who tend to quit the bank:
- exploratory analysis,  
- customer segmentation,  
- hypothesis formulation and testing.  
  
1. Data Examination, 
2. Data Pre-processing,
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (distributions of probability of customers leaving by attributes):
    + analysing customer activity (payment amounts, age of purchases, number of products used),
    + analysis of customer churn by attributes (gender, age, etc.),
    + segmentation by combined attributes (based on probability distributions of leaving)
3. Statistical Analysis:
    + hypothesis generation and testing,
4. Summary.

## Task 2: A/B test
  
Evaluate the results of the A/B test:  
1. evaluate the accuracy of the test:  
   + make sure there is no overlap with a competing test and no users participating in two test groups at the same time,  
   + check if the users are evenly distributed among the test groups and if they are formed correctly.
2. analyse the results.  

## Task 3: SQL using Jupyter  

1. Count how many books were published after 1 January 2000,  
2. For each book, count the number of reviews and the average rating,  
3. Identify the publisher that has published the largest number of books thicker than 50 pages - so you can exclude brochures from the analysis,  
4. identify the author with the highest average rating of books - only books with 50 or more ratings should be considered,  
5. calculate the average number of reviews from users who gave more than 48 ratings.
