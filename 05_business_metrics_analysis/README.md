## Analysis of the advertising channels for an online shop
Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the last few months. The task is to understand the reasons and help the company to get back to profit.

There is data about users brought in from 1 May to 27 October 2019:

- server log with data about their visits,
- a download of their purchases during that period,
- advertising expenses.
 
### General summary:
Analysing the business metrics led to the understanding that spending on advertising is being done unnecessarily. We see that ad spend in the US is high and not paying off despite having the largest number of users. A detailed dive into the company's performance in the US reveals that no device is paying off there. Clearly see the poor performance of TipTop and FaceBoom ad channels in the US. YRabbit, MediaTornado and RocketSuperAds channels are performing well in the US, it is better to invest money in advertising through these channels. Also pay attention to the UK channel AdNonSense with very poor performance and think about its necessity. The European channel LeapBob shows itself very well: low cost of attracting customers and high ROI - more investments can be directed there.

In terms of devices, advertising doesn't pay off on most platforms except PC. If we look separately, it turns out that in the US advertising does not pay off on any device, but in Europe it pays off on all of them.

In the context of advertising channels, we see that 7 out of 10 channels have passed the payback threshold, with 2 out of 3 not paying off being the most costly, and dramatically so. The marketing department needs to reconsider the need to expand the product in the US because of the huge expenditures on advertising. It is necessary to calculate the reasonableness of spending on certain channels of advertising, because not always a large expenditure on advertising equals great success. Explore cultural sensitivities that may make a presence in the U.S. market unnecessary.

To improve conversion rates, it is always important to follow all steps of the customer: whether the website is user-friendly, whether the registration form is convenient, whether there is enough information on the product, whether the order is processed in a timely manner, and so on. To work on customer retention you should pay attention to: product and service quality, support and feedback, loyalty programmes, bonuses after purchase, exclusive offers for customers, SMM. It is well known that the probability of selling a product to a new customer is on average 20-50%, and 60-70% to an old one.
