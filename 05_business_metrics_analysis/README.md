# Business decision on the result of business metrics:

**Purpose:**  
to find out the reasons for the company's losses and propose options for solving the problems.

Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the last few months. The task is to understand the reasons and help the company to get back to profit.

There is data about users brought in from 1 May to 27 October 2019:

- server log with data about their visits,
- a download of their purchases during that period,
- advertising expenses.
 
**To be studied:**  
where users come from and what devices they use,
how much it costs to bring in users from different advertising channels;
how much money each customer brings in,
when the cost of client aquisition pays off,
what factors prevent customer attraction.

**What was done:**  
analyze business metrics,  
calculate marketing and product metrics (LTV, CAC, retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU and others),  
use cohort analysis and metrics calculation functions,  
come up with conclusions about the causes of losses based on calculated metrics and graphs.
