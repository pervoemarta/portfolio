## Scooter rental service
This project is carried out to analyse the popular scooter rental service. Having data about some users from several cities and their rides, let's analyse them and test some hypotheses that can help the business grow.  

### General summary:

In this study, we prepared and processed the data: corrected data types, checked blanks, removed duplicates.

We added missing data, merged three tables into one for the convenience of calculations for the set tasks, visualised the received information, answered the set questions, worked out the hypotheses.

**The main conclusions of the hypotheses testing:**  

Time spent on travelling with and without subscription is different, it is necessary to carry out additional research and find out which trips are more numerous. Also we got the data that the length of the trip is different, we cannot say that 3130 m is the minimum distance. Also in the study we worked out a hypothesis about the revenue from users with and without subscription, the revenues are definitely not equal, users with subscription bring more revenue.
