# Aggregated project - 1
I helped the shop to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns using **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **scipy**.


## Campaign for the online game shop  
It was required to identify the patterns determining the success of the game.

### General summary
We studied historical open source data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms. Based on the available data, we can guess which games will be selling well in 2017:
- for platforms: PS4, PS3, XOne, PSV for all markets, and 3DS for the Asian market.
- by genre: action, shooters, sports for all markets, and role-playing for Japan. For NA and EU market the important factor will be ESRB rating: M, E - for all markets, E, T - for Japan (but remember that the Japanese video game market is big, there is a different rating system).
- we also determined that critics' ratings play an important role for sales: the top 5 games according to critics' ratings are action games for a variety of platforms, which we have already realised as a result of other analyses.
